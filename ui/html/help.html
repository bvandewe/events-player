            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>
                This micro-app serves as a test subscriber for <a href="https://cloudevents.io/">CloudEvents</a>. 
                It exposes a <span class="code">POST /events/pub</span> endpoint that Publishers can use to send events.
                Upon reception of a valid CloudEvent, the app distributes it to all browsers that are connected at that time, if any.
                It can also generate test events and send them to the selected CloudEvent Gateway.
                (Gateways can be added by Administrators with an Environment variable).
            </p>
            <p>
                Open the generator, select the localhost Gateway, and send an event. It will appear in the UI.
                <br>
                Select another Gateway, send an event, and if the event matches a subscription directed towards the CloudEvent Player, it should receive the event back.
            </p>
